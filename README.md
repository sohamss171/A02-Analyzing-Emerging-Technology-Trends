# Analyzing-Technology-Trends
According to a recent article by Forbes, 70% of job seekers believe the current labor market is not conducive to landing new job opportunities. This sentiment is also emphasized by the increasing time companies are taking to hire new employees and the growing number of interviews candidates must undergo, creating a challenging landscape for job seekers. To help navigate this environment, we have conducted an analysis of the skills required for software developer positions, focusing on the programming languages employers are requesting. This analysis is based on the 2024 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey, which includes responses from over 65,000 developers regarding their programming experiences and engagement with artificial intelligence. The primary objective is to empower employees to effectively navigate their job search. By examining AI usage trends, preferences for programming languages among different age groups, and platforms favored in the IT industry, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights into current job trends and in-demand skills. Our goal is to help employees identify key areas of focus in their job search, such as programming languages and technologies to prioritize for enhanced employability.

**Problem Definition & Data Source**
Problem Definition:

This project aims to assess emerging technology trends and provide insights into the current and future demand for programming and technology skills in the job market for software developers. Identifying the most in-demand programming languages and database skills. Compare and visualize trends from the 2024 survey with those from 2023 to determine any shifts in demand over the past years. Investigating and forecasting the future usage of the programming languages identified as the most in demand for 2025. Compare the programming skills identified in the initial analysis with the languages advertised on job postings (LinkedIn).

Motivation and Summary
Motivation:

The project analyzes tech stack trends from Stack Overflow surveys and LinkedIn job postings. By identifying emerging technologies and assessing skill alignment from 2023 to 2024, it provides insights to guide students on key skills to prioritize, while helping professionals and companies navigate a rapidly evolving tech landscape.

**Summary:**

In this project, we utilized three datasets—the 2023 and 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Surveys, along with data obtained through LinkedIn web scraping—to analyze trends in technology within the current job market. Our analysis includes four main parts: technology trends, compensation analysis for technology roles, LinkedIn job posts analysis, and clustering. For the first part, we found that while ChatGPT remains the most popular AI tool, other AI tools have also started to grow in popularity. In the analysis of programming languages, we found that JavaScript maintains high popularity across all age groups. Interestingly, older age groups tend to prefer stable and mature languages such as Java and C++. Additionally, for MSBA students, Python and SQL are the most important programming languages. We also conducted an analysis of tools, databases, platforms, and web development frameworks. In the compensation analysis, we found that the highest-paying tech roles are Senior Executives, AI Developers, and Engineering Managers, with average salaries around or above 200,000 dollars. Additionally, specialized and rare languages like 'Flow' and 'Scala' also command higher salaries. In LinkedIn job listings, we observed that companies have a high demand for Python and SQL, and these two technologies are frequently mentioned together, highlighting their dominance in data analysis, machine learning, and backend development. Finally, we used machine learning to cluster various technologies and developer skills.
